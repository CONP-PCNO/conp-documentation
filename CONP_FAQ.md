1. **What is CONP?**

The Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform is an open science infrastructure for sharing neuroscience data.  More information can be found [here](https://conp.ca).

2. **What data are contained in CONP?**

CONP contains a diverse range of 30 datasets (March 2020), primarily neuroimaging but also transcriptomics, genomics, and other related data modalities.  Many of these datasets come from neuroscience research institutes, while others link to public resources that may be of interest to neuroscientists. A full list can be found [here](https://portal.conp.ca/search).

4. **How do I download data from CONP?**

Results pages for the individual datasets contain instructions for downloading that dataset.  At the moment, access to datasets is made available through the [DataLad](www.datalad.org) data management system.  Download at the push of a button is under development and will be available shortly.

5. **How do I upload data to CONP?**

Data can be uploaded to CONP either through Zenodo, by tagging your dataset with the keyword 'canadian-open-neuroscience-platform', or manually through DataLad.  [Detailed technical instructions](https://github.com/CONP-PCNO/conp-documentation/blob/master/datalad_dataset_addition_procedure.md) are available for both these options.

6. **Why should I upload data to CONP?**

Uploading to CONP will increase its visibility and accessibility to other neuroscience researchers in a collaboration-focused, open science environment.
