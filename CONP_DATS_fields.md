|keywords|**REQUIRED**. Tags associated with the dataset, which will help in its discovery. We suggest entering at least 5 keywords, different from the datatype.|
|distributions - format|**REQUIRED**. Primary data files format (*example*: csv, nifti, txt, fasta).|
|distributions - size|**REQUIRED**. Total size of the dataset.|
|distributions - unit|**REQUIRED**. Unit in which the size is measured.(*example*: GB)|
|distributions - access|**REQUIRED**. Web address where the original dataset can be found.|

|extraProperties - subjects|**REQUIRED**. Total number of subjects constituting the dataset.|
|primaryPublications|**RECOMMENDED**. The primary publication(s) associated with the dataset, usually describing how the dataset was produced.|
|dimensions|**RECOMMENDED**. The different dimensions (granular components) making up a dataset. Providing dimensions give more details about the data types.|
|identifier|**RECOMMENDED**. Primary identifier for the dataset. Provide a *Document Object Identifier (DOI)* if you have one.|
|extraProperties - contact|**RECOMMENDED**. Provide contact information (name, email, telephone) of the person responsible for the dataset.|
|extraProperties - logo|**RECOMMENDED**. Link to or provide a logo to display on your resource landing page.|

|isAbout|**OPTIONAL**. Entities (biological entity, taxonomic information, disease, molecular entity, anatomical part, treatment) associated with this dataset.|
|hasPart|**OPTIONAL**. A dataset that is a subset of this dataset; datasets declaring the 'hasPart' relationship are considered a collection of datasets.  The aggregation criteria should be included in the 'description' field.|
|acknowledges|**OPTIONAL**. Grant(s) which funded and supported the work reported by the dataset.|
|refinement|**OPTIONAL**. Qualifier describing the level of data processing of the dataset and its distributions.|
|aggregation|**OPTIONAL**. Qualifier indicating whether the entity represents an 'instance of a dataset' or a 'collection of datasets'.|
